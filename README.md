# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a dataset of car attributes to predict the selling prices of used cars. The objective is to develop regression models that accurately estimate car prices based on features such as mileage, car age, fuel type, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **name**: Car model name  
- **year**: Year of manufacture  
- **selling_price**: Price at which the car is sold  
- **km_driven**: Distance driven (in kilometers)  
- **fuel**: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)  
- **seller_type**: Type of seller (Individual or Dealer)  
- **transmission**: Transmission type (Manual or Automatic)  
- **owner**: Number of previous owners  

## Models
Two regression models were applied to predict car prices:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Lasso Regression**

## Results
Both models were evaluated for their performance in predicting car prices. Comparisons were made to determine which model could more effectively capture the relationships between car attributes and price.
