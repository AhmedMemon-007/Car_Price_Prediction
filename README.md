# Car_Price_Prediction

*Project Overview*
This project uses a dataset of car attributes to predict the selling price of used cars. The aim is to develop regression models that accurately estimate car prices based on features like mileage, car age, fuel type, and other relevant factors.

*Dataset*
The dataset contains the following columns:

name: Car model name
year: Year of manufacture
selling_price: Price at which the car is sold
km_driven: Distance driven (in kilometers)
fuel: Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)
seller_type: Whether the seller is an individual or a dealer
transmission: Transmission type (Manual or Automatic)
owner: Number of previous owners
*Models*
I applied two regression models to predict car prices:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression

*Results*
Both models were evaluated based on their performance in predicting car prices. Comparisons were made to understand which model could better capture the relationships between car attributes and price.
